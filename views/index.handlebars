        <p class='sub-description'>No two opponents are ever truly the same, and games are much more interesting that way. Each army has strengths and advantages its opponent doesn't. Don't challenge the Lady Merfolk in the water, obviously.</p>

        <h2 class='description-header'><span class='glyphicon glyphicon-pushpin'></span>Tactical</h2>
        <p class='sub-description'>You'll have to plan your path to victory around obstacles that are advantages for your opponent, and a surefire path to defeat for you. Strategy matters.</p>

        <h2 class='description-header'><span class='glyphicon glyphicon-ice-lolly-tasted'></span>Weird</h2>
        <p class='sub-description'>Elves are great and all, but where are our armies made up entirely of a fierce femme Merfolk race? Mechanized insects with a haughty distaste for sand? An Old Growth Forest that likes to break for afternoon tea? We've got the weird armies here.</p>

      <p class='sub-about'>We're a group of ambitious gamers who also happen to be web developers. We're creators who use Javascript to build what exists in our imaginations.</p>

      <p class='sub-about'>Trident of Mina is the brainchild of Daniel Blat who envisioned a new tactical rpg experience with challenging mechanics and interesting narrative-based armies. The game was built with the coding contributions by Daniel himself, Sara Hjelt, Lindsay Wall, and Brandon Pfeiffer.</p>
