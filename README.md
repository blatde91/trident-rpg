# Trident of Mina
## a tactical RPG

***Trident of Mina*** is the brainchild of <a href="https://github.com/blatde91">Daniel Blat</a>, who envisioned a new tactical RPG experience with challenging mechanics and interesting narrative-based armies. The game was built with the coding contributions by Daniel himself, Sara Hjelt, <a href="http://github.com/catslug">Lindsay Wall</a>, and <a href="http://github.com/brandon-Pfeiffer">Brandon Pfeiffer</a>.

### User Story
*Trident of Mina* uses <a href="http://phaser.io/">Phaser</a> as the game engine. All game tiles and sprites are by <a href="http://pousse.rapiere.free.fr/tome/">David E. Gervais</a> and used under a Creative Commons 3.0 License.

### User Authentication
The game allows for user authentication, which allows you to enter the site and play the game. Authentication credentials are saved and hashed securely so you can login again anytime. Once signed in, you'll be redirected to a dashboard where you can create a new game. *Please note that while the game's database does associate game IDs with your username, save game functionality is not yet in place and the "Continue Game" buttons that show up on your dashboard are merely placeholders.*

### How To Play
Each character on the board was designed asymmetrically with different health, attack, and defense abilities. These are conveniently outlined in a table at the bottom of the page. Select the tiles to move your army across the board and watch the enemies' movement towards you. If you encounter an enemy sprite on your journey across the board, you'll fight to the death. You win by capturing your opponent's base.
